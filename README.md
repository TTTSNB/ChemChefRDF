--WHAT IS ChemChefRDF?--

ChemChefRDF (CCRDF) is a suite of open-source resources, including a well-defined methodology (i.e., set of inter-connected workflows), enabling its users to...

SEARCH FOR CHEMICAL REACTION RECIPES: query existing chemical reaction recipes using preexisting query models or custom, semantic prototype recipes.

IDENTIFY MISSING INGREDIENTS: quickly enumerate all the componnets necessary to bringing about some reaction, as well as: componets currently missing from YOUR lab, componets missing but realizable with what YOU have on-hand, or componets that are both missing and presently unrealizable.

SHARE RECIPIES WITH OTHERS: easily swap reaction recipes, as well as custom recipe prototypes, with both colleages and journals.


--WHY USE ChemChefRDF?--

A ONE-STOP SOLUTION SHOP: all CCRDF resources are available here on the ChemChefRDF GitHub page, open-source, organized by solution, and accompanied by step-by-step instructions for realizing each of the outcomes listed above (as well as suggestions for any pre-requisite, or pre-supposed, tutorials).

DESIGNED WITH NON-CODERS IN MIND: CCRDF's methodology, workflows and resources are all either low-code or no-code. 

SERVES AS AN INTRODUCTION SEMANTIC WEB TECHNOLOGY: in the process of using CCRDF you will gain a basic familiarity with the Semantic Web Protocols (RDF, RDFS, OWL2, SPARQL, SHACL, R2RML), as well as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) methodologies, which opens the door to a whole world of semantic representation use cases.
