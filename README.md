# WELCOME TO ChemChefRDF!

*Currently Under Development; Pardon Our Dust*

## WHAT IS ChemChefRDF?

**ChemChefRDF** (CCRDF) is a suite of open-source resources, interconnected workflows, and tutorials, which jointly enable its users to:

+ **DISCOVER REACTION "RECIPES"** using either provided query patterns or prototype recipes that we'll teach you to construct.

+ **IDENTIFY MISSING INGREDIENTS** with query outputs providing an enumeration of all listed recipe components (i.e., input and setup items) and indications of components that may be: (a) missing from YOUR lab, (b) missing but realizable with what YOUR lab has on-hand, or (c) both missing and unrealizable.

+ **SHARE RECIPES and PROTOTYPES** with colleagues and journals, in a number of formats. 

## WHY USE ChemChefRDF?

+ **DESIGNED WITH NON-CODERS IN MIND**: Our workflows offer low-code/no-code solutions and our tutorials are written for a general, scientific audience.

+ **BASIC SEMANTIC WEB TUTORIAL**: CCRDF users will become familiar, almost as if by osmosis, with World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Semantic Web Protocols (RDF, RDFS, OWL2, SPARQL, SHACL, R2RML), as well as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) methodology, which opens up a brave new world of semantic representation use cases.

+ **ONE-STOP SOLUTION SHOP**: All CCRDF resources are available here on the ChemChefRDF GitHub page, open-source, organized by solution, and accompanied by step-by-step instructions for realizing each of the outcomes listed above (as well as suggestions for any pre-requisite, or pre-supposed, tutorials).
