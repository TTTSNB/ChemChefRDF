# WELCOME TO ChemChefRDF!

*Currently Under Development; Pardon Our Dust*

## WHAT IS ChemChefRDF?

**ChemChefRDF** (CCRDF) *is a suite of open-source resources, including a well-defined set of inter-connected workflows, enabling its users to...*

+ **SEARCH FOR CHEMICAL REACTION RECIPES:** *Identify "recipes" for existing chemical reactions using either the query models that we provide and teach you to customize or semantic, prototype recipes we teach you to write.*

+ **IDENTIFY MISSING INGREDIENTS:** *Quickly enumerate all listed recipe components (i.e., input and setup items) for some selected reaction, as well as any components that may be: (a) missing from YOUR lab, (b) missing but realizable with what YOUR lab has on-hand, or (c) both missing and unrealizable.*

+ **SHARE RECIPES WITH OTHERS** *Easily swap reaction recipes, as well as custom recipe prototypes, with both colleagues and journals.*

## WHY USE ChemChefRDF?

+ **A ONE-STOP SOLUTION SHOP:** *All CCRDF resources are available here on the ChemChefRDF GitHub page, open-source, organized by solution, and accompanied by step-by-step instructions for realizing each of the outcomes listed above (as well as suggestions for any pre-requisite, or pre-supposed, tutorials).*

+ **DESIGNED WITH NON-CODERS IN MIND:** *CCRDF's methodology, workflows and resources are all either low-code or no-code.*

+ **SERVES AS AN INTRODUCTION SEMANTIC WEB TECHNOLOGY:** *In the process of using CCRDF you will gain a basic familiarity with the Semantic Web Protocols (RDF, RDFS, OWL2, SPARQL, SHACL, R2RML), as well as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) methodologies, which opens the door to a whole world of semantic representation use cases.*
